Heartbeat Checklist
===================
Add tasks below for your agent to check during periodic heartbeat polls.
Keep this file small to limit token burn. Delete comments once you've configured it.

Example entries:

- [ ] Check email for urgent messages
- [ ] Review calendar for events in next 2 hours
- [ ] Check weather if outdoor plans today
- [ ] Scan social mentions/notifications
- [ ] Review memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md and update MEMORY.md if needed

Tips:
- Rotate checks across heartbeats (don't do everything every time)
- Track last-check timestamps in memory/heartbeat-state.json
- Keep the list to 3-5 items max per heartbeat
- Leave this file empty (or comments only) to skip heartbeat processing

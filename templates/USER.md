## Context

_(What do they care about? What projects are they working on? What annoys them? What makes them laugh? Build this over time.)_

## Preferences

## Projects

_(Active projects, goals, deadlines. Keep this updated as things change.)_

The more you know, the better you can help. But remember — you're learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference.

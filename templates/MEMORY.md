# MEMORY.md - Long-Term Memory

<!-- 
This is your agent's curated long-term memory. It's the distilled essence of what matters,
not a raw log. Think of it as the difference between a journal and a summary of your life.

SECURITY: This file is only loaded in main (private) sessions with your human.
Never loaded in group chats or shared contexts to prevent leaking personal info.

Update this periodically by reviewing daily memory files and pulling out what's worth keeping.
Remove outdated info that's no longer relevant.

     - **Location:** San Francisco
     - **Work:** Product manager at a startup
     - **Personality:** Direct communicator, values efficiency
     - **Pet peeves:** Sycophantic AI responses, unnecessary meetings
-->

     - **Side project:** Learning Rust. Working through the book on weekends.
-->

## Infrastructure

<!-- Technical details about your setup. VM specs, services, integrations.
     Example:
     - **VM:** GCP us-central1, 4GB RAM
     - **Channels:** Telegram (primary), Discord (team)
     - **Integrations:** Notion API, Gmail, Google Calendar
-->

## Cron Schedule

<!-- What's running on autopilot. Include times in your human's timezone.
     Example:
     - 7:00am: Morning digest
     - 12:00pm: Email check
     - 9:00pm: Daily reflection prompt
     - Sunday 10am: Weekly review
-->

## Hard Rules

<!-- Non-negotiable rules established with your human. These override everything else.
     Example:
     - ASK before sending any emails or public posts
     - Always use Eastern Time, never UTC
     - No em dashes in messages
     - Never force push to main/master
-->

## Pending Actions

<!-- Things that need doing but aren't done yet. Check these during heartbeats.
     Example:
     - Set up calendar integration
     - Create backup script
     - Review and update MEMORY.md (last done: Jan 15)
-->

## Personal Context

<!-- Important personal context that helps you be a better assistant.
     Birthdays, preferences, ongoing life events, inside jokes.
     Be respectful. This is about being helpful, not surveillance.
     Example:
     - Moving to new apartment in March
     - Training for a marathon. Don't schedule early mornings.
     - Favorite coffee: oat milk latte
-->

## Lessons Learned

<!-- Things you've figured out the hard way. Document mistakes so future-you doesn't repeat them.
     Example:
     - Session compaction can lose messages. Check screenshots when human says you missed something.
     - Don't pre-split long messages. Let the platform handle chunking.
     - Stagger cron jobs by 5-15 min to avoid out-of-order delivery

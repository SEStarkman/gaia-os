# Client Onboarding Kit

One initialization prompt that does everything.

## How It Works

OpenClaw already creates the default workspace files (SOUL.md, USER.md, AGENTS.md, etc.) on setup. We don't replace them. Instead, the client pastes our **Initialization Prompt** as their first message to the agent.

The prompt teaches the agent to:
1. Have a natural first conversation (not a form)
2. Learn about the human (name, work, preferences, pet peeves)
3. Define its own personality (humor, formality, voice)
4. Set hard rules and boundaries
5. Structure its memory system properly (daily files + MEMORY.md)
6. Write everything to the right workspace files

## Files

- `INITIALIZATION-PROMPT.md` — The prompt. Copy the content between the ``` markers.

## Delivery

Share via Notion export (PDF) or just copy-paste the prompt in an email. Client pastes it as their first message to their new agent and the conversation handles the rest.

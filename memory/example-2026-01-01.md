# 2026-01-01

## Tasks
- Morning digest (email + calendar)
- Reviewed memory/2025-12-31.md for carryover tasks
- Drafted weekly review summary for Sunday

## Notes
- Human asked about automating LinkedIn posting cadence
- Found article about new OpenClaw release. Flagged for update later.
- Noticed Telegram link previews are turned on; human dislikes this (add to TO-DO)

## Decisions
- Defer OpenClaw update until after today's meetings
- Suggested using Homework for Life prompt at 9pm ET (human agreed)

## Pending Actions
- [ ] Add calendar integration skill to roadmap
- [ ] Update MEMORY.md after weekend review
- [ ] Disable Telegram link previews once main session quiets down

## Lessons
- Morning digest runs smoother when daily memory file exists before 6am
- Always double-check channel config before toggling link previews (requires gateway restart)

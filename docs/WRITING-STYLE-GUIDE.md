# Writing Style Guide (Template)

<!-- 
This is a template writing style guide for your agent. Customize the voice, platform strategy,
and examples for your own use. The STRUCTURE and BANNED PATTERNS are universally useful.
They prevent AI-generated content from sounding like AI-generated content.

_Writing in your voice, optimized for the platforms you use._

---

## Voice & Style

<!-- Define how your content should sound. -->

**Core principles:**
- Simple wins. Cut extra words. First sentence grabs.
- One thought per sentence. Active voice. Vivid words.
- Short paragraphs (1-2 sentences). Bold key phrases. Line breaks for scannability.
- Have opinions. Vary rhythm. Admit complexity. Use "I". Be specific.

## Platform Strategy

<!-- Define which platforms you use and what goes where. -->

### Platform 1 (e.g., X/Twitter)
- **Topics:** _What you post about_
- **Tone:** _How you sound here_
- **Format:** Short-form, punchy

### Platform 2 (e.g., Newsletter)
- **Topics:** _What you write about_
- **Tone:** _How you sound here_
- **Format:** Long-form, essay-style

### Platform 3 (e.g., LinkedIn)
- **Topics:** _What you share_
- **Tone:** _How you sound here_
- **Format:** Professional, educational

**Platform routing:** Not every idea fits every platform. A pure tech hack might be X only. A psychological insight might be Newsletter + LinkedIn. Route content to where it fits.

## Content Strategy

<!-- What works, what doesn't. Customize for your audience. -->

- **Optimize for engagement.** Every post needs something people want to respond to: a question, an incomplete thought, a hot take, a fill-in-the-blank.
- **Optimize for dwell time.** Strong hook, scannable format, progressive revelation, ending worth reading to.
- **Quality over quantity.** One great post beats five mediocre posts.

### Hooks

**Core principle:** Open with a bold, declarative statement that creates an information gap. The curiosity comes from the *content*, not a gimmicky frame.

**Good hooks:**
- Make a surprising claim or statement of fact
- State something concrete that happened
- Say something bold enough that people need to keep reading
- Let the "how" or "why" remain unanswered. That's what pulls them in.

**Examples of strong openers:**
```
I built my software startup in 6 months completely by myself.
The only moat any company will have in 2026 is distribution.
Most productivity advice is designed to make you feel busy, not get results.
```

### Formats

- **List + Question:** X things about [topic]. What would you add?
- **Hot Take:** [Statement]. [Reasoning]. Agree or disagree?
- **Observation:** [Trend noticed]. [Why it matters].
- **Story + Lesson:** [Hook]. [Story]. The lesson: [insight].

## Never Do This

### Banned AI Vocabulary

These words and phrases are dead giveaways for AI-generated content. Zero tolerance.

additionally, furthermore, moreover, testament to, landscape (as metaphor), showcasing, highlighting, crucial, vital, essential, tapestry, interplay, multifaceted, vibrant, breathtaking, delve, dive into, unpack, "it's worth noting," "in order to" (say "to"), "due to the fact that" (say "because"), "at the end of the day," "moving forward," "let me explain," "real value," "the real value is," "add value," "true value," "actual value" (just say what the thing does or why it matters), "the best part?" (just say the thing)

### Banned AI Structures

- **Contrasting pairs.** State your point directly instead of:
  - "It's not X, it's Y" / "It's not just X, it's Y"
  - "Don't do A. Do B." / "Stop X. Start Y."
  - "Not only...but also" / "Less X, more Y"
  - "Without X? Y. With X? Z."
  - Any structure that sets up a false dichotomy or contrast
- **Echo sentences.** "It sounds X. It was X." or "It seemed Y. It was Y."
- **"Here's what nobody..." / "Here's the part no one talks about."** Just say it directly.
- Forced rule of three. Use natural quantities.
- Synonym cycling ("app...platform...tool"). Repeat the clearest term.
- "From X to Y" false ranges. Be specific.
- "Serves as," "functions as." Just say "is."

### Banned Hooks

- "I did X. Here's what I learned."
- "Here's what happened" / "Here's why"
- Question openers ("Want to know how I...?")
- "Most people think X. The reality is different."
- "[Time] ago, I [situation]. It changed everything."
- Fabricated hooks. NEVER invent a scenario that didn't happen.

### Banned Tones

- Significance inflation ("pivotal moment," "revolutionary," "game-changing")
- Promotional language ("unparalleled," "best-in-class")
- Vague attributions ("experts agree"). Name the source or drop it.
- Generic conclusions ("time will tell"). End with specifics or questions.

### Formatting Violations

- Em dash overuse
- Boldface overuse
- Emoji overuse
- "**Term:** definition" list format for everything

### Absolute Rule: Never Lie

- NEVER fabricate experiences, statistics, or capabilities
- Only reference things you've actually built, done, or set up
- When in doubt, be vague rather than specific

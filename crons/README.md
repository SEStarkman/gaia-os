# Automations

Your agent can do things on a schedule — check your email every morning, scan social media for trends, remind you to reflect at night. In OpenClaw, these are called **crons**.

You don't need to write config files or learn cron syntax. Just tell your agent what you want and when.

## How to Set One Up

Say something like this in chat:

> "Every weekday morning at 7am, check my email and calendar and send me a summary of what's coming today."

Your agent will create the scheduled task for you. It'll ask clarifying questions if it needs them (which channel to deliver to, what timezone you're in, etc.).

To see what's running, manage timing, or turn things off — just ask your agent.

## Inspiration

Here are things people commonly automate. Use these as starting points — customize them to fit your life.

### ☀️ Morning Briefing

> "Every morning at 7am, check my email for anything urgent, look at my calendar for today and tomorrow, and check the weather. Send me a quick summary."

Wake up to a snapshot of your day instead of digging through three apps.

### 📱 Content Scanning

> "Every few hours during the day, scan X/Twitter for trending posts about AI. Find 2-3 I should reply to and draft some ideas."

Stay on top of your niche without doomscrolling. Works for any topic — replace "AI" with whatever you care about.

### 🧠 Memory Maintenance

> "Every Sunday morning, review my daily memory files from the past week and update MEMORY.md with anything worth keeping long-term."

Your agent journals what happens each day. This automation distills the important stuff so nothing gets lost.

### 📝 Daily Reflection

> "Every night at 9pm, send me a quick prompt asking about the most meaningful moment of my day."

Inspired by Matthew Dicks' "Homework for Life" concept. A small daily practice that builds up over time.

### ⏰ Reminders

> "Remind me every Friday at 3pm to submit my weekly report."

> "On March 1st at 9am, remind me that the project proposal is due."

Simple reminders — recurring or one-time.

### 📊 Weekly Review

> "Every Sunday at 10am, check my pending actions, review what happened this week, and flag anything that's been sitting for more than two weeks."

A weekly check-in that keeps things from falling through the cracks.

### 📧 Email Monitoring

> "Check my email every 2 hours during work hours. Only ping me if something looks urgent."

Your agent filters the noise so you don't have to.

## Tips

- **Be specific about timing.** "Every morning" is vague — "Every weekday at 7:30am Eastern" is clear.

- **Tell it where to send results.** "Send it to Telegram" or "just update my memory file, no notification needed."

- **Start simple.** One or two automations first. Add more as you get comfortable.

- **Your agent handles the technical parts.** You describe what you want in plain English. The agent figures out the scheduling, the prompts, and the delivery.

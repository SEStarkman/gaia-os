  "prompt": "Send a Homework for Life prompt to the main channel.\n\nThe concept (from Matthew Dicks' 'Storyworthy'): Every day, write down the one moment that was most story-worthy. Not the biggest event — the most meaningful, surprising, or emotionally resonant moment. It can be tiny.\n\nSend a brief, warm prompt asking your human to reflect on their day. Vary the prompt each time — don't repeat the same question. Examples:\n- What surprised you today?\n- What's one moment from today you'd tell a friend about?\n- When did you feel something unexpected today?\n- What conversation stuck with you?\n- What would you title today's chapter?\n\nKeep it to 1-2 sentences. Don't be cheesy. Don't over-explain the concept every time.\n\nIf they respond, save their answer to the daily memory file and optionally to a dedicated Homework for Life database (Notion, file, etc.).",
